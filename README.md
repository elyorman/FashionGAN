# FashionGAN
Train StyleGAN 2 ADA on Fashion images and generate images with it. This jupyter notebook only includes generating images using the pre-trained model and training part will be addad later. The model used in this repository is the checkpoint of 3200 kimgs so the results are not great yet. 

## Dataset for training 
For gathering training images [pyimgdata](https://github.com/jeffheaton/pyimgdata), an open source project was used.
